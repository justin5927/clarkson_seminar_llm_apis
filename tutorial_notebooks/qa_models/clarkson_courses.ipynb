Students will work on planning, analysis, preliminary design, simulation, construction, testing and evaluation, documentation, class demonstrations, and oral presentations. The main focus of this course is to provide students with an opportunity to develop complete solutions to design problems and to develop broad engineering skills, including communication skills. Prerequisite: EE311.\n",

CE 490(3) Civil Engineering Senior Design: This course involves teams of students working on a comprehensive design project related to core areas of civil engineering design and construction management. The design will be based on knowledge acquired in prior courses, professional ethics, and engineering economics. Students will be required to write reports and make oral presentations about their design to faculty, potential guests, and student peers. Prerequisites: Senior standing, CE310, and either CE441 or CE442 (or consent of the instructor).\n"
